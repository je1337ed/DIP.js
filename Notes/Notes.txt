***********Questions********************
1. Should I create a pixel rgba object so that it reads more clearly for pixel.red as opposed to pixel[0]? 
2. should I let the users save filters in local storage?
3. maybe show a default for the different filters, maybe thumbnails of the various 
transforms done in the background

4. look into making dynamic elements on the page and clearing them. 
(addendum: figure out how to position the divs appropriately)

5. create matrix dynamically? gaussian is easy...

6. allow for resizing of images.

7. preload matrices and allow rotation?

**********TODO**************************

1. figure out the code for generating a pdf (probability density function) from the data

2. figure out the code for generating a fft of the image and showing the fft and inverse fft for an image.


3. --notes for histogram equalization
implement histogram equalization
Normalization is a linear process. If the intensity range of the image is 50 to 180 and 
the desired range is 0 to 255 the process entails subtracting 50 from each of pixel intensity,
 making the range 0 to 130. Then each pixel intensity is multiplied by 255/130, 
 making the range 0 to 255

4. implement a loop and a queue for delaying processing
add a multiple progress meter div to show the progress of various tasks.

5. look at implementing various means of optimizing the existing code.

6. figure out how to implement the wiener filter for blind deconvolution.
